# LED Sign Project

The vision for this project is to build an extendable and highly configurable LED panel sign controller.
Core features are to emulate "basic" scrolling LED signs, and provide a way to easily format and display relevant information from web feeds, etc.
Planned modules include stock market, weather, time, arbitrary json content extraction, spectrum analyzer.


# Current Status
* Software to draw and animate a basic sign made of a bunch of elements is basic, but usable.
* Test board firmware and host side control software working pretty well
* Having trouble getting the FPGA to boot. Looking into it
* Once HW is verified, will revise to fix errors and post updated PCB designs.

Next update? Probably around Dec 5.
